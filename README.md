# â‹†ï½¡Â°âœ© reddit-user-comment-api âœ©Â°ï½¡â‹†  

Ever needed to ~~cyberstalk someone at 3am~~ dig through someone's reddit comments, then tear at the lack of search options? I bestow upon you *filters* and *search* and **power**. Not revolutionary in the slightest but nonetheless helpful (i hope?)

Is it RESTful?  
kinda  
Does it have tests?  
absolutely not  
does it work?  
Surprisingly, yes... well at least i think so.

ð“†©â™¡ð“†ª **anyway heres the link have fun :3** ð“†©â™¡ð“†ª   
[vercel link here lol]
